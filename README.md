# Breast Cancer Classification

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant. The system utilizes logistic regression to analyze various tumor measurements and provide accurate classification results.

## Technical Details

### Implementation
The project is built using Python and employs several key libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sklearn.datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```

### Features
- Automated tumor classification (benign/malignant)
- High accuracy rate using logistic regression
- Comprehensive data preprocessing
- Model performance evaluation
- Support for both built-in and custom datasets

### Data Processing
The system processes tumor measurement data through several stages:
1. Data loading from multiple sources
2. Feature extraction and preprocessing
3. Train-test split implementation
4. Model training and evaluation

## Usage Instructions

### Setup
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the classification system:
```bash
python breast_cancer_classification.py
```

### Data Requirements
The system accepts data in two formats:
- Direct import from scikit-learn's breast cancer dataset
- Custom CSV files with appropriate feature columns

## Model Performance
The implementation achieves high accuracy through:
- Careful feature selection
- Robust preprocessing
- Optimized logistic regression parameters
- Comprehensive accuracy evaluation

## Future Improvements
Potential enhancements include:
- Implementation of additional classification algorithms
- Enhanced feature selection methods
- Cross-validation implementation
- User interface development
